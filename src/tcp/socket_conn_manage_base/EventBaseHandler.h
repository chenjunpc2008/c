    It is guaranteed that when this callback is invoked, some data has
    been received. Therefore, the "data" parameter is never empty.

    This callback is invoked asynchronously when a connected client tries
    to signal end of session and that client has no more data to send.

    When this callback is invoked, the connection should be at half-closed
    state. There should be no data remaining to be received. Hence,
    OnReceiveData will no longer be called for this connection.

    To perform a graceful shutdown, perform the following.
    1. Send all the data that you need to send. It is not required to
    send all remaining data within this callback. The connection will
    remain in half-closed state as long as the connected client also
    wish to perform graceful shutdown.

    2. Once all remaining data are sent, Call
    CIocpServer.Shutdown(cid, SD_SEND) to close the other half of
    of the connection.

    3. Finally, call CIocpServer.Disconnect(cid) to fully close the socket.
    After this, the OnDisconnect callback will be asynchronously called
    through one of the IOCP thread. The connection is then fully
    terminated.

    @param[in] cid :  A unique Id that represents the connection.
    This is the unique key that may be used for bookkeeping, and will remain
    valid until OnDisconnect is called.

    This callback is invoked through the context of an IOCP thread, which
    may or may not be your main thread's context.

    If this function is not overridden, the default behavior is to
    immediately close the other half of the socket, and fully close the
    connection.	After this, the OnDisconnect callback will be called
    through one of the IOCP thread. The connection is fully terminated.
